# üëã Hello world!
Love doing analysis to solve problems in the best possible way and helping people understand new concepts. Perfectionistic in code quality, open to any challenge, willing to step out of comfort zone.
 - Earned Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Informatics (Slovak University of Technology - FIIT).

 #### **Interactive tutorials in machine learning (2018)**
 <img src="https://github.com/freezpmark/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Dash_app3.jpg" align="right" width="300" height="192"/>
 <p align="justify">Created a web application that provides interactive and extensive visualizations of Naive Bayes classifier allowing us to deeply track its computational processes. Used a freshly released Dash framework in which the functionalities I used were not documented well yet. Along with this, I‚Äôve explained the fundamentals of ML in Bachelor's thesis and created an introductory tutorial for machine learning text classification methods in ipynb document. (Python, Dash framework, Jupyter Notebook, HTML, CSS)</p>

 #### **Artificial Intelligence algorithms (2020)**
 <img src="https://github.com/freezpmark/Artificial-Intelligence/blob/master/animation.gif" align='right' width='300' height='158'/>
 <p align="justify">Created an app that produces GIF animation that visualizes: creation of map in Zen garden approach, shortest path visiting all destinations, deducing new facts from facts that are being collected at certain destinations. The intention behind this project was to improve Python coding skills while practising implementation of some of the most widely mentioned algorithms in AI that don't use machine learning techniques. (Python)</p>

 <summary><b>üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me</b></summary>
 
 Ever since childhood, one of the things that always got my attention was Artificial Intelligence. Despite the fact it was just from a game, I have always found simulation of any kind of human behavior fascinating. These kinds of modern technologies will play a big part in shaping the future, and I believe and hope in a good way!

 I've picked this domain for my Bachelor thesis project that was about making a tutorial for explaining two text classification algorithms. Using the framework Dash that was just released at that time, I was able to provide extensive interactive visualizations on a web application that was allowing us to track computational processes behind the algorithm.
 I've been enjoying the whole process of implementing it a lot and did even more than I was asked to mainly because:
 - I love teaching and helping people understand how things work
 - I love doing analysis to solve problems in the best possible way
 - Learning and doing things I am passionate about

 When I started working on this project in Python for the first time, I realized that this language will suit my needs the best for programming. 
I've started my journey with Python and set a new goal to become an expert with this language. I like to dedicate myself to work for the goals I've set for myself until I succeed. So even after working hours, I tend to continue writing code at home. Recently I've been working on Discord bots, algorithms, and an app for practicing the Korean language. All during which I'm trying to uncover and learn new concepts of Python I haven't been yet familiar with.

 I also like learning and speaking English. I've been attending conversational English camps as a volunteer and lived in London for 8 months right after high school to work and improve my level. During my first job I became interested in Korean language and culture. After saving some money, I‚Äôve decided to move to South Korea and I‚Äôm currently looking for a way to work there.

 **My other interests:**
  - Guitar, Photography, Youtube
  - Physical/Mental Health
  - PC/Board Games
